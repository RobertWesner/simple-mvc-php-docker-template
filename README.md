Template with Docker integration for [robertwesner/simple-mvc-php](https://github.com/RobertWesner/simple-mvc-php)

Avoids all the boilerplate code. Created as more and more of my personal projects use the library.

It might not be "the most optimal docker integration" since it works with volumes rather than copying the code and has no separate production Dockerfile,
but it fits the description of "definitely good enough".
